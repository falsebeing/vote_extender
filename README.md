Predicts expected vote counts by current trend

Program tracks changes to one state per session

Each time you run the program you tell it the state to predict for and the current vote tally there. 
Then add however many counties you want. Tell program the current tally and percent reported for the county
Program will predict uncounted votes based on current trend

Add each county once without error
You can view the new state tally after adding new counties

There is no idiot-proofing
If you enter bad data there will probably be an error

No permanent data is saved for future sessions, but a .log file of the session is saved in the containing folder
